# Exercise 10 (Mini Project)

We will be deploying a real life application:

- Demo project <https://github.com/f1amy/laravel-realworld-example-app>
- Setup Debian 11 on a virtual machine with a cloud provider or as instructed.
- Setup Apache with every dependency the application needs to run.
- Don't use Laravel Sail or Docker as suggested in the project README file, simply clone the project with git and deploy with Apache
- Setup MySQL with credentials and a database for your application to use.
- Configure a subdomain if you have a domain name to point to the VM instance or speak to an instructor for further guide.
- You have completed the project if you are able to view the application according the specifications in the project from your host browser.
